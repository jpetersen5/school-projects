# Project: "Bricked"
Written in C++ and using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and OpenGL. Designed after Atari's Breakout but created from scratch (besides the library). The engine is simple but is able to handle rendering the game every frame, win / loss states, and simple physics including corner collisions (most of the time).

All code was written on a Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04) and successfully compiles and runs on Linux, but runs into compilation issues with Windows.
