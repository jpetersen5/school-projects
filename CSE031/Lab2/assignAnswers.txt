---Assignment 1---

1. Line 18, in the read_values function: "scanf("%d", input);"

2. Add a dereference operator to the line so that the types match
   scanf("%d", &input);
   
3. Sum is being changed in the read_values function, but after the function finishes sum in main is unchanged.

4. Change read_values to call by reference, changing the following lines
   10   int read_values(double *sum) {
   12   // sum = 0
   17   *sum += input;
   26   values = read_values(&sum);
   

---Assignment 2---

1. No, the expected output is "HELLO!hello!" but actual output is "HELLO!hello!llo!"

2. No, the expected output is "HI!hi!" but actual output is "HI!hi!hellhi!"
   It looks like accidental characters are being appended as well due to a lack of end character.
   This is fixed by adding the line "s1[s2len+s1len] = '\0';" after the for loop in append

3. str1 isn't complete, str2 is appended twice, then also some junk characters that don't display properly. 
   Because the strings are longer than the space allocated, the append function gets kind of funky writing in 
   space that isn't allocated by the string arrays
