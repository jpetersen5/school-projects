1. Static: for global variable storage
   Stack: for local variable storage
   Heap: for dynamic storage
   
2. a. 3 variables
   b. 2 are pointers, ptr points to the int num and handle points to the int pointer ptr
   c. ptr and handle are created in the stack, but the memory they store is in the heap. num is on the stack
   d. Since ptr points to num, it's pointing to the stack

1. NodeStruct.c defines the struct Node that holds an int and a float, and of course the pointer to the next node.
   A first node named head is dynamically allocated in main, with the values 5 and 3.14. 
   
3. The structs contents are stored in the heap whereas the structs address is in the stack. 
   head's destination is the start of the Node, where the int iValue is stored but not pointing to the same thing
