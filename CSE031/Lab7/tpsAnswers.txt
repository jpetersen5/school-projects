1. A procedure is a series of actions. A function is a
   basic task. A method is a systematic procedure.

4. Line 20; this line sums the two variables into the
   register used for jr

5. No, a function would not be able to be called multiple
   times if it was built this way.

6. At line 11 the register is being set to 0, which does
   not make sense and would cause errors.

7. Error in : invalid program counter value: 0x00000000

8. 0x00400020

9. It was moved down 2 instructions and $ra is now
   incorrect.

10. The address is now 0x00400028. Output is 15

11. Use jal instead of j

1. 38

3. When SUM calls SUB, $ra is changed to the address
   right after jal SUB is called, so jr $ra in SUM returns
   there instead and the program will get stuck in a loop.

4. Backup values in memory

5. $s0 is overwritten, which causes issues after jal SUM
   in MAIN since $s0 is used assuming the previous value.
