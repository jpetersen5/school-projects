5. Store the returned value into register $a0
   (print's argument) before changing $v0

7. Store the return address first

10. $a0 is the argument for recursion and is
	used in both recursion calls, so if it's
	changed during one call then the second call
	wouldn't be accurate.

12. Calling recursion right away would overwrite
	the last call's returned value. Store $v0 to
	the stack to prevent it

15. Return address
