# Computer Organization and Assembly Language - C / Assembly
Lab 1: Basic C IO and logic

Lab 2: C pointers and arrays using pointer logic

Lab 3: C array sort and search using pointer logic, linked nodes cycle detection, dynamic memory allocation

Lab 4: Matrix multiplication with 2D dynamic arrays + memory casting

Lab 5: Understanding assembly basics with MIPS + fibbonacci sequence in Assembly

Lab 6: Value comparison and summing in Assembly

Lab 7: Practice converting C algorithms into Assembly algorithms

Lab 8: More C to Assembly conversion, recursive algorithms

Lab 9: Assembly IO number comparison

Project 1: C - puzzle[1-3].txt are 2D dynamic arrays representing word search boards, which are then processed to find desired word (overlaps permitted, every found answer included)

Project 2: Assembly - uses stack data storage, stack data retrieval, and recursive methods to calculate the average score of a set of input scores
