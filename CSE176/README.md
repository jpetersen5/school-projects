Project: Evaluating Algorithms for Learning Decision Forests (Tree Ensembles)
Group project of 4 people
- Part 1: Binary classification using logistic regression and random forests on 2 digits from the MNISTmini dataset.
- Part 2: MNIST multiclass classification with XGBoost on the full MNIST dataset as well as the MNIST-LeNet5 dataset, obtained from a pre-trained LeNet5 convolutional neural net.
- Part 3: Binary imbalanced classification and regression. Our group was assigned the Scikit-learn Histogram Gradient Boosting Classification and Regression algorithms. The imbalanced classification dataset was [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and the regression dataset was a subset of the Million Song Dataset for [Year Prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/203/yearpredictionmsd)
